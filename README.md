# demo_code

This repo consist of three files.

1.Carla code

This code was developed in CVC lab ,Barcelona as a part of my internship.Please go through the various train/input/output folders to look at the various network architecture and augmentation techniques used to devise a fully autonomous control scheme for a mini self driving car.

2.Precision Landing Video

Please find precision_land.mp4.This video shows a drone inside the gazebo environment precisely landing on the smallest ArUco tag with an acccuracy of 15 cms.This work is finally productised and is being currently used by various people.

3.Path planning for drones

This code exposes high level APIs to make a map and add obstacles on the map ,so that drone can avoid any obstacles present while maneuvering inside the map.The whole code base is developed in ROS Python/C.
